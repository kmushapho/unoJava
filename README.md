  - Classic UNO Rules: Includes standard UNO game rules such as drawing cards, skip, reverse, wild cards, and more.

  - Terminal Interface: A simple and easy-to-use terminal-based interface for interacting with the game.

  - Game Flow: The game follows the standard UNO flow with each player taking turns to play their cards until one wins by getting rid of all their cards.
